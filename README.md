Virtual Classroom assignment


1. Importing the VirtualClassroomManager class
In this step, we import the VirtualClassroomManager class from your Python code file or module.

2. Creating an Instance of VirtualClassroomManager
Here, we create an instance of the VirtualClassroomManager class. This instance, manager, will allow us to interact with and use the methods provided by the class.

3. Adding a Classroom
We add a virtual classroom called "Math101" using the add_classroom method. This method checks if the classroom already exists and prints a message accordingly.

4. Enrolling a Student
We enroll a student with the ID "123" into the "Math101" classroom using the add_student method. It checks if the classroom exists and if the student is already enrolled in another class before enrolling them.

5. Scheduling an Assignment
We schedule an assignment with the name "Problem Set 1" for the "Math101" classroom using the schedule_assignment method. This method checks if the classroom exists and prints the assignment details.

6. Submitting an Assignment
A student with the ID "123" submits an assignment for the "Math101" classroom using the submit_assignment method. It checks if the student is enrolled in the specified classroom and prints the assignment details.

7. Handling Errors
If any of the actions performed (adding a classroom, enrolling a student, scheduling an assignment, or submitting an assignment) encounter an error, such as trying to perform an action on a non-existent classroom, or enrolling a student who is already enrolled in a class, the program prints an error message accordingly.

This code provides a simple interface for managing virtual classrooms, students, and assignments. You can extend and customize it as needed for your specific use case.
